# Objective

The aim of the document is to capture the group of frames in a Video
based on visual similarity.

# Dataset

We are working on the curated shoppable Video Ads. Training and testing
are being done on 158 such videos.

# Jupyter Notebook

# KPI to track

<http://perf.ads.jupyter1-n3.dailyhunt.in/groot/tree/gautham/shoppable_v2/kpi>

In future iterations, we would be aiming to improve intra-cluster
similarity score and inter-cluster silhouette distance for groups in a
video.

# Learnings / Observations from iteration 1

1.  Videos have audios as well we are currently not taking that into
    consideration

2.  Video Frames sometimes have texts, we are currently not processing
    them. In future iterations, we can get insights from them and
    recommend products

3.
