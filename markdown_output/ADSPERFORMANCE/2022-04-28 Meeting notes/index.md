##  Goals

List goals for this meeting (e.g., Set design priorities for FY19)

- Kickstart efforts towards Style Snap w.r.t to Shoppable Ads work.
  Discuss any open questions and expectations of the outcome

**Open Questions for better clarity**

1.  Videos should be in .mp4 format only? We need to check what video
    format we support.

2.  SLA of the Style snap training is not provided in the document.

3.  No response format is provided for /media/\<media_id\>\
    3.1 Would we get product details in this and what will be TTL for
    the product.\
    3.2 What if the price of the products changes?

4.  How to get the actual endpoint for Style Snap REST?

5.  Generate s3 Authorization Token and API key?

6.  Is it mandatory to upload the video to S3 or GCP is also fine?

7.  Would we have POC from Amazon? We need to check Public documents for
    programmatic access to APIs

**Expectations or Vision**?

1.  Keep in mind that we would want to have multi-tenant architecture.

2.  The first priority would be to have Accio and Style Snap in place
    and then have a comparison framework.

3.  Once the above is done, we will invest time/bandwidth on Inhouse
    Shoppable Ads and distribute traffic based on performance.
