##  Executive Summary

We want users to easily provide feedback on ads and upon receiving
critical feedback on an ad from a user, we want to ensure that the same
ad is not shown to the same user again.

##  Objective

To take direct user feedback into consideration to serve ads

##  Success metrics

List project goals and the metrics you\'ll use to judge its success.

  **Goal**                                                **Metric**
  To take user feedback into consideration to serve ads   Number feedback forms submitted
                                                          
  ------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------

## Competitive Analysis

Most video streaming platforms allow users to submit feedback.

##  Assumptions

Users feel agitated when they see the same ad twice, especially the ones
they'd submitted negative feedback on.

##  Functional Specifications

When a user currently reports an ad, he is directed to the following
form:

\

We do not currently do anything with this feedback form. This form
should have the following radio button options:\
1) Do not show this ad\
2) Too many ads\
3) Other

Every time user clicks on 1), the particular ad should never be served
for user again.
