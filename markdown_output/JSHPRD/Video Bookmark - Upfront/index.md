##  Executive Summary

**Problem statement:** In the current product it is difficult for users
to save the video for future reference. For creators there created
videos are the sunk-cost but for the platform like Josh where 99% users
are consumers, functionality to save videos to the collection can act as
a sunk-cost for larger chunk of users.

**Data Analytics:**

1.  How many users use Bookmark for Videos & other entities (Share %es
    also)

2.  What the screens from which bookmark is happening?

3.  Visit to Bookmark page, consumption of bookmark entities?

##  Objective

Make it easy for the user to bookmark the posts by bringing it upfront
next to the engagement icons, so that user can save the posts to their
bookmark list for future reference easily.
