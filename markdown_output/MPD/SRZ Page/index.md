**Overview**

Smart Reading Zone (SRZ) is a geo-fenced feature that businesses
(Hotels, Airports, Corporates, Educational Institutions, etc.) use to
offer unlimited reading access on the Magzter app at their locations.
Anyone within a Smart Reading Zone can instantly access all Magzter GOLD
titles on the Magzter app without needing to purchase individual
subscriptions, making it a seamless and hassle-free experience.
