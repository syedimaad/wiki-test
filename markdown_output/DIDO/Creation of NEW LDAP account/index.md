**Step 1** : Browse the *selfcare* URL

<https://selfcare.newshunt.com/>

**Step 2:** Login the portal with your LDAP credentials.

**Step 3**:Go to ***New*** ***user*** option

\

**Step 4:** Mention the user id and email id ( Email id should be the
company mail id and user id should be same as email-id's user name )

**Note: Make sure that there is no space included at any place.**

*Eg*: **user id** == xyz

**email id** == <xvz@dailyhunt.in>

And click the person account box which implies that the account is
personal account. If we uncheck that person account option then it
implies that it is a common user
