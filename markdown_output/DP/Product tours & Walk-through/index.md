## Context & Summary

Users learn by doing, but they need a kernel of awareness to get
started. App walkthroughs meet users at the start of their journey
through the product and help them unearth valuable features hidden
beneath the surface. They foster good usage habits in new users that
lead to increased retention.

## First-principles note ( Go-deeper level)

1.  **What is the purpose of the walk-through for different user
    personas? If yes? what types?**

- As a **news user,** I need a walkthrough to understand the different
  features inside the product which will help me for easy adoption the
  product

- As a daily user of dailyhunt, I need to be updated with the **new
  features** coming in and what is the purpose of those features, this
  will help me in engaging with the app more efficiently

- As a user, I am only comfortable using some of the **basic features**,
  still not aware of many other features which can be helpful for me,
  guides might help me to understand those complex features

- I started using the dailyhunt app but **got churned** due to not being
  able to understand the app properly or not understanding the value it
  is creating for me, guides, in the beginning, realizing the value
  might have been helpful

Below are the other reasons why we should do walkthroughs:

- Users only stick with products if they quickly understand their value.

- Compel users to take specific, meaningful actions in your app. Instead
  of leaving users to figure out your app on their own, product tours
  influence user behavior by explaining why each step is essential and
  guiding users to take critical actions within your product.

- Most onboarding processes focus on driving users to their "[[aha
  moment]{.underline},]{style="color: rgb(76,154,255);"}" that moment
  when users finally understand how a product can positively impact
  their lives. This helps retain new users immediately

- It can be simple to build and experiment with.

**Some of the stats around healthy onboarding:**

- 42% of customers stated that the onboarding process played a role in
  their decision to buy.

- If a customer is highly engaged, they will buy 90% more frequently and
  spend 60% more per transaction.

- 74% of customers will be more likely to check in again to a
  user-friendly website, and 50% will not return if the site is not.

- 90% of customers believe businesses could provide a better onboarding
  process.

- 74% of customers will switch brands if they find the purchasing
  process difficult.

- 80% of people delete apps if they do not know how to use them.

Owning to the above research, let us try to draw a pain/gain graph for
these features:

### **As we are clear that the walk-through will add value to the users, now it\'s necessary to understand why we are revamping it, what are the problems with the current one, and how are they performing?**

We will try to understand

- what are our core events

- if they have guides or not

- are guides relevant (based on data)

- what can be improved

- competitor analysis

#### Channels driving users to the app:

  ------------------- --------------
  **Source**          **May 2022**
  PRELOAD             5232446
  Organic             2787526
  googleadwords_int   2277538
  GP-Non Incent       1554302
  Preburn             1442496
  Others              1122148
  ------------------- --------------

### Data Insights:

1.  13% of the user bounced during the first session indicating that
    either they were forced pushed inside the app or did not find any
    value in the app

2.  Only 17% of the user come for the 2nd session again indicating and
    supporting the analysis made in the first step

## Assumptions

1.  The pre-burn users are forced to the app via notifications and
    don\'t see any value in the app due to various reasons so get
    churned

2.  Other kinds of users are not able to understand value props beyond a
    certain point, not stick to the app for long

##  Functional Specifications

Owing to all the research and analysis we are doing on functional
specifications, we try to look at these problems

### [Experiments- 1]{style="color: rgb(76,154,255);"}

Product tours during the first launch

segment: Pre-burn users

Timeline- 2 weeks

Data metrics: Bounce rates, interactions on the product tours

Specifications:

- show core values/events

- Ability to skip

- one-time view

- After language screen

### [Experiments- 2]{style="color: rgb(76,154,255);"}

Gamification of the onboarding process

segment: 5% of the total users

Timeline- 2 weeks

Data metrics: Bounce rates, how many people completing tasks

Specifications:

- show core things they needs to complete

- check-list in the profile section

- connected to badges option in future

### [Experiments- 3]{style="color: rgb(76,154,255);"}

Navigation walk-throughs

segment: 5% of the total users

Timeline- 2 weeks

Data metrics: Bounce rates, how many people completing tasks

Specifications:

- show core things they needs to complete

- check-list in the profile section

- connected to badges option in future

1.  The first launch should focus on explaining the value of props
    explanation

2.  How to make the discovery of core events easy for the user

3.  Nudge users to the core events

4.  Helps users maintain a check-list of tasks completed inside the app

5.  creative notification during sub-sequent launches like tried posting
    feature yet and redirect to the posting page

6.  Till how many launches, we can show the walkthrough- frequencies

a\. should it be a subsequent launch or every 2 launches till 4-6
launches- advised is continuous launches

b\.

8\. Controlled experimentation with specific sets of user

a\. since pre-burn users are one of the most frequent churned categories
can we do product tours for them to start

b\.

### How to standardize guides across the platform

- A quick-win checklist to keep motivation high

Within seconds of launching the app, new users can click a single button
and tick off the first step in the onboarding process, unlocking the
"feel good" factor that comes from a job well done.

- A partially completed checklist to drive feature adoption- relate to
  badges n leaderboards

Getting users to explore and adopt new features is an important part of
creating product stickiness and improving retention. But it's easier
said than done. 

- The subtle checklist that lets users go at their own pace

##  Success metrics

Successful onboarding experiences could be measured or defined in a
number of ways: 

- They have achieved FVD (first value delivered) with product or
  service.

- The customer or client may not have reached that VFD point, but they
  do see the potential and future value of a relationship with your
  brand. This could be the point during a free trial where the customer
  realizes that the next step is to make a full purchase. 

List project goals and the metrics you\'ll use to judge its success.
