## Context & Summary

The Discovery page will provide users with a range of News/topics,
curated just for the users. This is where users can find what's
happening & what's trending, right now.

## First principles note

- Top sections are curated

- Idea is to show content and not thumbnails for sections

- Hence unbundling each section

- Every X carousels you can show thumbnails ( i.e. recommended source,
  topics etc) ... but these are interspersed and fewer

- Each carousel to have only 5 - 10 items with See All option.

- See All opens up the relevant deep link - source / topic / hashtag /
  location / inbox etc. 

- The bottom part is kept for user signal/profile stuff \-- i.e.
  everything users followed. 

- The sequence of the same can be basis the last updated article time...
  or by affinity score

##  Objective

To provide a destination page to the user where the user can discover
the popular pages/sections/topics that are live on DH.
