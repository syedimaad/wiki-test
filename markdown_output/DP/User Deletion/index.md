## Context &Â Summary

All the users in the DH app should have a control on their profile to
delete the account as it is a mandate form the government and the social
media sites like FB, Google and others.

We are creating a flow for the user to delete their DH account and
adhere to the laws.

## First principles note

- Allow the user to delete the DH account.\
  - How the user is able to delete the DH account?\
  - What all information is needed to delete the users DH account?\
  - What will happen if the user account is deleted?\
  - How the user will be able to restore the deleted account?

## What are we changing?

As a user, if I have created an account on the DH app I am not able to
delete my account as I don\'t see any option to delete my account.

We will be providing the user with the an option of getting their
account deactivated/deleted.
