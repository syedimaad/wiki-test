## Context & Summary

Charcha corner - Space where users share opinions about specific topics 

## First Principle Notes

Our vision for charcha corner is to make it interactive and engaging by
providing users with relevant topics to discuss upon and make their
engagement as friction free as possible.

What are instances where we can use charcha corner? how to solve the
discovery of it ?

  genre level
