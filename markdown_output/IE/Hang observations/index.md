1.  **Hang in PlayerAudioService.setCategoryPlayback() â†’
    \[AVAudioSession setCategory:error:\] ()**

**Issue Summary**

- **Symptom:** Main thread becomes unresponsive while a video is
  playing.

- **Trigger:** Plugging in or disconnecting **external headphones or
  earphones** (wired or Bluetooth).

- **Frequency:** Intermittent but reproducible on affected devices.

- **Main Thread Hang Location:**

  - AVAudioSession.setCategory(\_:error:)\
    â†³ mediaremoted processor

**Root Cause Analysis**

- When an external audio device is connected/disconnected while media is
  actively playing, the app internally triggers a \`outputVolume\`
  changed notification

- Thread Analysis (Instruments):

  - The hang is **not in app logic**, but in **system-level IPC** with
    the `mediaremoted` process.

  - Stack traces show that `[AVAudioSession setCategory:]` **blocks
    until the route change is fully processed** by the OS.

**Reference**

- This issue is also reported on the Apple Developer Forums:

Observation 2:

Calling **AVAudioSession.sharedInstance().setCategory** repeatedly in
main thread will cause the delay in execution so moving this to global
thread with priority `userInitiated.`

And also recommended this method to call only once, since this is called
on every mute, unmute, stop, pause and restart.
